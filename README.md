# Bookshop Management System

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) desktop application built with Java Swing and MySQL. The application allows users to manage basic information about customers in a bookshop by performing operations like adding, deleting, updating, and searching for records. The data is stored in a MySQL database, and the interface is designed using Java Swing for a user-friendly experience.
